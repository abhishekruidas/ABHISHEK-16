# Bug Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document details 3 critical security and logic bugs that were identified and fixed in the Flask web application.

## Bug 1: SQL Injection Vulnerability

### Problem Description
The `get_user_by_id` function was vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to direct string concatenation in SQL queries.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
cursor.execute(query)
```

### Impact
- Attackers could execute arbitrary SQL commands
- Potential data theft, data manipulation, or database corruption
- Complete compromise of the database

### Fix Applied
Replaced direct string concatenation with parameterized queries:

**Fixed Code:**
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

### Security Improvement
- Prevents SQL injection by properly escaping user input
- Uses database engine's built-in parameter binding
- Maintains query performance while ensuring security

## Bug 2: Insecure Password Hashing (MD5)

### Problem Description
The password hashing function used MD5, which is cryptographically broken and can be easily cracked.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```python
def hash_password(password):
    return hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()
```

### Impact
- MD5 hashes can be cracked using rainbow tables
- Weak protection against password attacks
- Potential compromise of user accounts

### Fix Applied
Replaced MD5 with bcrypt, a secure password hashing algorithm:

**Fixed Code:**
```python
def hash_password(password):
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    return bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt).decode('utf-8')

def verify_password(password, hashed_password):
    return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), hashed_password.encode('utf-8'))
```

### Security Improvement
- bcrypt is designed specifically for password hashing
- Includes salt generation and configurable work factor
- Resistant to rainbow table and brute force attacks
- Industry standard for secure password storage

## Bug 3: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

### Problem Description
The search function directly injected user input into HTML without proper escaping, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```python
template = f"""
<html>
    <head><title>Search Results</title></head>
    <body>
        <h1>Search Results for: {query}</h1>
        <p>No results found for your query.</p>
    </body>
</html>
"""
```

### Impact
- Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript
- Session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement
- Potential for complete client-side compromise

### Fix Applied
Added proper HTML escaping using Flask's escape function:

**Fixed Code:**
```python
from flask import escape

@app.route('/search')
def search():
    query = request.args.get('q', '')
    escaped_query = escape(query)
    template = f"""
    <html>
        <head><title>Search Results</title></head>
        <body>
            <h1>Search Results for: {escaped_query}</h1>
            <p>No results found for your query.</p>
        </body>
    </html>
    """
    return render_template_string(template)
```

### Security Improvement
- Prevents XSS attacks by escaping special characters
- Converts potentially dangerous characters to HTML entities
- Maintains functionality while ensuring security

## Additional Dependencies
Updated `requirements.txt` to include bcrypt:
```
Flask==2.3.3
Werkzeug==2.3.7
bcrypt==4.0.1
```

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test SQL injection prevention with malicious input
2. Verify password hashing works correctly with bcrypt
3. Test XSS prevention with script tags and special characters
4. Run security scanning tools to verify fixes
5. Perform penetration testing on the fixed endpoints

## Best Practices Implemented
- Use parameterized queries for all database operations
- Implement secure password hashing with salt
- Always escape user input before rendering in templates
- Follow the principle of defense in depth
- Keep dependencies updated and secure
